# AnotherBrickInThePaywall
just a simple python script to open the contents of a webpage and ignore the annoying paywall used to obscure said contents
this program only works on removing paywalls from sites that load their contents in google results such as sites that post news articles and cover the news articles with annoying paywalls

requires installing beautiful soup and requests.

to install libraries:
"pip install bs4"
"pip install requests"

to use the program simply run using your preferred method of running python scripts.
to run using terminal line:

"python ripthetext.py"
at first prompt paste in or type out your site url that has the annoying paywall
at second prompt give the file a name of your choice and make sure to use a valid filename so no spaces and make sure that the filename ends in ".html"
the program should then immediately open a new browser instance that shows your preferred site with no paywall loaded.
